# Traffic-Prediction-and-Forecasting
This project seeks to leverage historically collected data from over 140 urban zones to forecast and predict traffic conditions in the future. It is an attempt to establish correlation between features such as weather and temperature with road traffic conditions. We also sought to forecast how the traffic flow will fluctuate in the future using time-series forecasting to identify traffic flow trends in future time periods.
